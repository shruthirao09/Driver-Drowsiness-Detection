# Driver-Drowsiness-Detection
This project talks about early detection of drowsiness (Anti Sleeping Alarm).

Driver drowsiness is a significant factor in road accidents, leading to severe injuries and fatalities. Early detection of drowsiness can prevent many of these accidents by alerting the driver before they reach a dangerous level of fatigue. This project presents a driver drowsiness detection system utilizing an Arduino microcontroller and an eye blink sensor. The system is designed to monitor the driver's eye blink patterns to identify signs of drowsiness.

The eye blink sensor, attached to a pair of glasses or mounted on the dashboard, continuously measures the driver's eye blink rate. The Arduino microcontroller processes the data from the sensor to detect abnormal blink patterns indicative of drowsiness, such as prolonged eye closure or unusually frequent blinking. When drowsiness is detected, the system triggers an alarm to alert the driver, encouraging them to take a break or use other fatigue countermeasures.

The proposed system is cost-effective, easy to implement, and non-intrusive, making it suitable for a wide range of vehicles. Experimental results demonstrate the system's capability to accurately detect drowsiness, with a high sensitivity to variations in blink patterns. This technology has the potential to significantly enhance road safety by reducing the risk of accidents caused by driver fatigue. Future work will focus on integrating this system with vehicle control systems for automated responses, improving detection algorithms, and expanding the range of detectable drowsiness indicators.
